Using Soundtrack
----------------

The Soundtrack window appears when you open Soundtrack (either by
clicking its icon in Finder or in your Dock).

Click on the "Play" button.  You will see an activity indicator as
Soundtrack tunes into the radio station.

Once the music starts playing, the title of the currently playing song
will appear in the Soundtrack window.

To pause the music, click anywhere in the Soundtrack window.

You can move the Soundtrack window around in your screen by clicking
and dragging anywhere inside the window.  You can resize the
Soundtrack window by dragging the edges.

Click the "zoom" button (the green button in the button set at the top
left of the Soundtrack window) to make Soundtrack full screen;
clicking it again will make Soundtrack into a window again.

Option-clicking the zoom button will toggle between the default size
and any resizing that you've done.

Click the "close" button (the red button in the button set at the top
left of the Soundtrack window) to hide the Soundtrack window.  To make
it visible again, click on the Soundtrack icon in the Dock.

There are keyboard shortcuts for some common tasks:
