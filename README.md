## About

When doing tasks that require primarily mental movements (for example,
programming, designing, writing; or just thinking), some people, some
times, are hampered by the mind's tendency to fidget.

There is a certain genre of music that helps some of those people, at
some of those some times, to get in the "zone".

Soundtrack plays such music.

The essential part is the music, and it comes from SomaFM's matchless
[Drone Zone](http://somafm.com/dronezone/) internet radio station. 

You can easily listen to this music on their website, or in their app,
or with your existing music player.

Soundtrack has a more minimalist approach. There is only one
button. Guess what it does.
