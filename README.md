# Soundtrack ‚å¨

Soundtrack is a minimalistic internet radio player for macOS and
iOS. It allows you to tune into one radio station. Subsequently you
can quickly play/pause that station by clicking the status bar
icon. You get notifications for song changes.

To set the radio station, paste the URL of the radio station in the
Soundtrack window. This is the HTTP link to the shoutcast playlist
file, ending in ".pls" or ".m3u".
