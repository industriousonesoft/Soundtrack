# Soundtrack ‚å¨

Minimalistic internet radio player.

## Building Soundtrack from Source

There are no external dependencies. Download the source code, then
build and run in Xcode.

Before running, you need to tell Soundtrack about the URL of your
internet radio server.  You can do this with the following command:

    defaults write com.github.mnvr.Soundtrack.Soundtrack-macOS shoutcastURLs -array "http://your.shoutcast-or-icecast-endpoint.com/etc"

Note that this in not the URL to the playlist (M3U/PLS) file, but the
URL of the SHOUTcast/ICEcast server endpoint itself.  If in doubt, you
can obtain this value by downloading the playlist file and reading it
in a text editor.
