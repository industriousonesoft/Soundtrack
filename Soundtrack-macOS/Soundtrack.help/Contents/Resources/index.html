<h1>Using Soundtrack</h1>

<p>

The Soundtrack window appears when you open Soundtrack (either by
clicking its icon in Finder or in your Dock).

</p>
<p>

Click on the play button in the middle of the Soundtrack window.  This
button is shaped like the Soundtrack icon.  You will see an activity
indicator as Soundtrack tunes into the radio station.

</p>
<p>

Once the music starts playing, the title of the currently playing song
will appear in the Soundtrack window.

</p>
<p>

To pause the music, click anywhere in the Soundtrack window.

</p>
<p>

You can move the Soundtrack window around in your screen by clicking
and dragging anywhere inside the window.  You can resize the
Soundtrack window by dragging the edges.

</p>
<p>

Click the "zoom" button (the green button in the button set at the top
left of the Soundtrack window) to make Soundtrack full screen;
clicking it again will make Soundtrack into a window again.

</p>
<p>

Option-clicking the zoom button will toggle between the default size
and any resizing that you've done.

</p>
<p>

Click the "close" button (the red button in the button set at the top
left of the Soundtrack window) to hide the Soundtrack window.  To make
it visible again, click on the Soundtrack icon in the Dock.

</p>
<p>

Soundtrack adds an icon to the "Menu Extras" / "Status Bar" area at
the top right of your screen.  You can click this icon to play or
pause Soundtrack.

</p>
<p>

The icon will appear dimmed if Soundtrack is not currently playing any
music.

</p>
<p>

When Soundtrack is playing music, then you can see the title of the
currently playing song as the tooltip of this status bar icon.

</p>
<p>

If you wish, you can disable this status bar icon by using the "Status
Bar Icon" toggle item in the "View" menu.

</p>
<p>

When the Soundtrack window is not visible, Soundtrack will slide in a
notification from the right of the screen when the song changes.  If
you wish, you can disable these notification by using the "Song Change
Notifications" toggle item in the "View" menu.

</p>
<p>

There are keyboard shortcuts for some common tasks:

</p>

<blockquote>

    <table>
    <tr>
    <td><em>Space</em> &nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td>Play/Pause</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><em>Command-H</em> &nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td>Hide the Soundtrack window</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

</blockquote>
