<h1>Using Soundtrack</h1>

<p>

The Soundtrack window appears when you open Soundtrack (either by
clicking its icon in Finder or in your Dock).

</p>
<p>

Click on the play button in the middle of the Soundtrack window (the
is shaped like the Soundtrack icon).  You will see an activity
indicator as Soundtrack tunes into the radio station.

</p>
<p>

Once the music starts playing, the title of the currently playing song
will appear in the Soundtrack window.

</p>
<p>

To pause the music, click anywhere in the Soundtrack window.

</p>
<p>

You can move the Soundtrack window around in your screen by clicking
and dragging anywhere inside the window.  You can resize the
Soundtrack window by dragging the edges.

</p>
<p>

Click the "zoom" button (the green button in the button set at the top
left of the Soundtrack window) to make Soundtrack full screen;
clicking it again will make Soundtrack into a window again.

</p>
<p>

Option-clicking the zoom button will toggle between the default size
and any resizing that you've done.

</p>
<p>

Click the "close" button (the red button in the button set at the top
left of the Soundtrack window) to hide the Soundtrack window.  To make
